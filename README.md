# Discapp Dev

This repository contains the code that handles command hot reloading in [Discapp](https://github.com/Discappjs/discapp).

## About

This package uses Chokidar for watching and automatically replacing recently changed or added commands in your Discapp project.

This package will also alert you to restart your app if changes were made to files in the root directory.

This is a separated package so we can add extra features in the future without polluting the Discapp application with unnecessary code.
